## About this portfolio

Since I was young, I've loved all things spooky 👻 One of my favorite movie franchises is the Alien franchise and one of my favorite games is Alien Isolation. If you've seen these movies/played this game, you know about the iconic user interfaces used throughout them 📟📺 I decided to design my portfolio based on this design style, called 'Retro Futurism' and the iconic 'Cyberpunk' style, seen throughout a lot of games and movies like The Matrix and Blade Runner.
